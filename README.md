Blockchain &amp; Cryptocurrency using Javascript/Node.js

Blockchain is a special - distributed and decentralized database ( financial ledger ) which stores data like transactions and that is publicly shared across all the nodes in its network.

I have developed feature to implement distributed and decentralized blockchain technology, where miners can add blocks of transactions, validate the blockchain and synchronize the chain over the network.
- Features:
  1. Used Javascript object-oriented programming style ( ES5-ES6).
  2. Hosted on http server using Express.js runing on Node.js. 
  3. Generated hashes for blocks in the chain using crypto-js/sha256 module. Create an API around the Blockchain
  4. Jest is used to write Unit Test Components of the Blockchain.
  5. Used websocket (ws) ato establish real-time peer-to-peer connection server.
  6. Implemented a proof-of-work algorithm.
